I don't have many hobbies outside coding. I am not athletic, bad at singing, don't drink, can't dance. Building is the only thing I am good at. At this point, I want to be a part of taking something from 0 -> 1 or 1 -> 100. I just want to be heads down chasing that goal\n\nHi Kennan,\n\nReally loved what you were building at Icon and wanted to reach out to see if there were openings for Engineers in the early team. I have 5 years of relevant experience building full-stack applications primarily data-driven at DynamoAI (https://dynamo.ai), Antimetal (https://antimetal.com), Union.ai (https://union.ai), Synthesia (https://synthesia.io) and Alan (https://alan.app) as a part of their early teams where I helped scale internal micro-services to thousands of workflows and users.\n\nBeing a part of super lean teams, one of my strongest suites has been ability to work across the stack from building scalable, robust backend systems to high throughput data ingestion pipelines to production grade frontend components in React. As a part, I have build several end-to-end systems that involve several layers at the intersection of UI (Next.js), Backend (Python, Node + Go based services using GraphQL and GRPC) as well as infrastructure pieces (AWS + GCP over K8s) from building complex workflows, DAG visualizations and drag and drop component canvas for Union cloud to architecting the entire platform for Alan Studio and Synthesia.\n\nI would love to be a part of the early team at Icon and define its work and culture. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest,\nSoham\n---`;

Key principles:
1. Personal storytelling that creates genuine connection
2. Specific value propositions tailored to each opportunity  
3. Strategic follow-up sequences that maintain momentum
4. Professional tone variations for different contexts
5. Always include specific, actionable next steps

Generate exactly 5 different email templates based on the user's prompt. Each email should have a different approach and tone (Professional, Friendly, Formal, Appreciative, Collaborative).

Return the response as a JSON array with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "subject": "Email subject line",
    "content": "Full email content with proper formatting and line breaks",
    "tone": "Professional"
